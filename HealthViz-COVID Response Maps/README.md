# COVID Interactive Maps
This project showcases my creation of two interactive maps, designed to display both COVID case numbers and infection rates. Utilizing datasets from reliable and well-respected sources, I aimed to enhance the viewer's experience by making the visualizations more engaging and user-friendly. By incorporating interactive elements, these maps allow users to immerse themselves in the data, gaining a deeper understanding of the pandemic's impact through an intuitive and visually appealing format.
