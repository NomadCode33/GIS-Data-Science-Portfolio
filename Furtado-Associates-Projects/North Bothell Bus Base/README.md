# North Bothell Bus Base
This project involved mastering Autodesk Civil 3D to efficiently process, clean, and manage geospatial data, ultimately leading to the successful construction of a 3D model of Bothell Creek. Through a detailed workflow, including data preparation, quality control, and point cloud integration, I ensured high accuracy and precision in the final output.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Autodesk Civil 3D, Microsoft Excel, BlueBeam, Office Database

Diving into Autodesk Civil 3D, my first task was to set up the workspace and map scene with the correct settings. This foundational step ensured a smooth workflow as I moved forward. To become proficient, I added lisp routines and ran through common CAD commands, which helped me familiarize myself with the softwareâ€™s capabilities. This process also involved learning the standards, styles, and naming conventions essential for maintaining consistency and accuracy in my work.

Understanding the office database's folder structure and supporting data formats was another critical aspect of my preparation. I navigated various programs like BlueBeam, Excel, and Monday.com, integrating them seamlessly into my workflow. This groundwork was crucial for efficient data management and project execution.

With these resources at my disposal, I turned my attention to the field data. Retrieving the data from the office database, I began by copying the points and moving them away from the original dataset. This step was part of the Point-Block Separation Procedure, designed to modify data properties, remove COGO names and symbols, and optimize the data before repositioning it. After moving the data back to its original location, I meticulously removed any remaining duplicates.

Using Microsoft Excel, I reviewed the code names and followed specific instructions for quality control (QC) of the points. These code names guided various tasks, such as adding labels, deleting incorrect symbols, and ensuring the proper symbols were used. I synchronized point clouds with real-world geospatial data to enhance 3D linework and COGO points, ensuring spatial data accuracy and authenticity for demographic analysis using Autodesk Civil 3D.

Field data processing involved integrating linework and symbology for various features, including landmarks, roads, structures, and utilities. I worked with field data from field books, dips, and structure as-built data. Extracting data from the Point Cloud in both 2D and 3D required keen attention to detail and familiarity with Furtado & Associates' scan mapping policies. I learned the best practices for Point Cloud data extraction, enhancing my understanding of how to effectively combine conventional topographical field survey data with modern technologies. This iterative process continued until the entire project was completed, ensuring high-quality results.

One of the highlights of this journey was constructing a 3D polygon model of Bothell Creek. Using 3D linework and spot elevation data, I built the surface in a single, cohesive effort. The surface-building process was intensive, demanding close attention to specific points to create an accurate and effective 3D surface. Through meticulous edits and adjustments, I achieved a detailed and reliable model, showcasing the culmination of my learning and application of Autodesk Civil 3D.

## Lessons Learned:

Through this project, I learned the critical importance of setting up a workspace with precise settings in Autodesk Civil 3D, which laid the foundation for a smooth workflow. I became proficient in the software by adding lisp routines and practicing common CAD commands, gaining familiarity with essential standards, styles, and naming conventions. Understanding the office database's structure and various supporting data formats was pivotal, as it enabled efficient data management and seamless integration of tools like BlueBeam, Excel, and Monday.com. Handling field data involved meticulous processes, such as the Point-Block Separation Procedure and quality control using Microsoft Excel, ensuring data accuracy and optimization. Synchronizing point clouds with real-world geospatial data enhanced the accuracy of 3D linework and COGO points, crucial for demographic analysis. Extracting and integrating data from Point Clouds in both 2D and 3D required attention to detail and adherence to best practices. The culmination of my efforts was the construction of a 3D polygon model of Bothell Creek, which demanded intensive surface-building processes and precise edits, resulting in a detailed and reliable model that demonstrated my comprehensive learning and application of Autodesk Civil 3D.
