# Lynnwood ROW Acquisition
The Right-of-Way (ROW) department ensures draft maps align with check drawings on Autodesk Civil 3D, handling permits, parcel maps, and quality checks through teamwork and regular Microsoft Teams meetings. My tasks included file protection, parcel map analysis with Civil 3D commands, QA/QC in BlueBeam, and data verification using county websites.

**Disclaimer:** Furtado & Associates maintains a policy of not allowing company property for personal use, so I don't have any documents or pictures of my project. However, I can describe the work I did and the process we followed.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Autodesk Civil 3D, Microsoft Word, Office Database, BlueBeam, Microsoft Teams

The Right-of-Way (ROW) department ensures that all elements on the draft map align with the check drawing on Autodesk Civil 3D. Collaboration is key, with team members working together to handle land use permits, parcel maps, and quality checks. We frequently used Microsoft Teams for meetings, discussing deadlines and specific project details to ensure everyone was on the same page.

I started my task by opening Autodesk Civil 3D and accessing the document for the parcel map from Lynnwood. To protect the original file, I made a copy before working on it. Within the file, I isolated the parcel map shape and moved it to a different location for analysis. Using the ncopy command, I carefully selected the lines needed and moved them to an empty space for better visibility. The ortho mode helped set directions, and specific commands like DA, pedit, and fillet allowed me to adjust and clean the data. I meticulously joined lines, removed duplicates with the overkill command, and used trim or break on necessary points. If any direction showed as South, I always flipped the coordinates to North or West for accuracy.

Once the map display was set, I conducted QA/QC in BlueBeam, comparing the parcel document to the original map source. I verified building measurements, zoning property lines, fee codes, easements, and building dimensions. Non-radial line checks and radial bearing line center arc checks were performed using specific commands and label adjustments to ensure precise measurements. I also utilized county websites like iMap to verify building dimensions and spatial information, ensuring all data matched accurately.

In BlueBeam, I looked for errors on the parcel map document, allowing easy editing and annotation. Different colors indicated various types of corrections: Red for additions, Green for removals, Blue for notes, Yellow for verified items, and more. This color-coded system facilitated clear communication and collaboration. At least two people had to agree on all corrections for them to pass, ensuring rigorous quality control.

Additionally, I learned to create legal documents using information from sources like iMap. I cited property information and other legal details essential for construction projects. By applying linear referencing techniques, I could pinpoint building landmarks accurately, aiding the development crew in making informed decisions. This experience honed my ability to present technical and non-technical information professionally to diverse audiences.

## Optimizations

In my work with the ROW department, I optimized the workflow by protecting original files through duplication and enhancing data visibility by isolating and relocating parcel maps. I improved accuracy by using commands like ncopy, DA, pedit, fillet, and overkill to clean and adjust data, and ensured consistency by flipping coordinates when needed. My QA/QC process in BlueBeam involved a color-coded system for clear communication and rigorous quality control, verified by multiple team members. I also streamlined legal document creation by referencing county websites, and applied linear referencing techniques to aid development decisions.

## Lessons Learned:

Working on this project taught me the importance of file protection, data accuracy, and meticulous QA/QC processes. I learned to use various Autodesk Civil 3D commands for data adjustment, ensuring precise measurements and clean data. Utilizing county websites for verification and a color-coded system in BlueBeam for error annotation improved collaboration and communication. The experience also enhanced my ability to create detailed legal documents and present information effectively to diverse audiences, both technical and non-technical.
