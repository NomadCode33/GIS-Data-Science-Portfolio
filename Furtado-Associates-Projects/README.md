# Furtado & Associates
A comprehensive three-month GIS internship involving rotations through four core departments—Field & Survey, GIS, Right-of-Way (ROW), and Drafting—designed to provide a well-rounded understanding of geospatial workflows and real-world applications. 

In the Field & Survey department, I utilized advanced tools such as the Leica P50 LiDAR Scanner and Trimble S/VX Series to perform precise area scanning and coordinate collection for development planning. 

Within the GIS department, I created basemaps using ArcGIS and AutoCAD Civil 3D, formatted data to client specifications, and developed detailed raster and vector maps to support infrastructure projects. 

In the ROW department, I conducted quality checks on parcel and legal maps, ensuring data accuracy, and drafted legal descriptions specifying easement boundaries and coordinates. 

The Drafting rotation deepened my understanding of 2D and 3D linework processing, symbology, and annotation, all derived from field-collected data. 

Each department offered unique challenges and learning opportunities, contributing to a comprehensive and engaging internship experience. Together, these rotations offered hands-on experience, technical skill-building, and a complete perspective on how GIS supports surveying, planning, and land development.
