# EcoPulse: Global Warming
A collaborative data analysis project examining the global impacts of climate change using datasets from the World Health Organization. The team processed, filtered, and visualized data in RStudio to explore key issues such as population displacement, agricultural disruption, and environmental vulnerability in regions most at risk. The findings are presented through a detailed report and a publicly accessible website, offering a clear, data-driven narrative to raise awareness and support informed decision-making.
