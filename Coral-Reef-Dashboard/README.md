## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Dashboards

I began by accessing ArcGIS Online to search for the NOAA Coral Reef Watch data. I opened it in Map Viewer to prepare the web map for the dashboard, thoroughly examining all the layers and features. The attribute table displayed crucial information such as Degree Heating Weeks and Alert Level, which are central to the dashboard I was creating. I selected the Human Geography Dark Map from the Basemap options and zoomed in to fill the map view. After saving the map and entering the appropriate information, I proceeded to create a new dashboard and chose the dark theme, updating the header to display the dashboard's title.

Next, I added list elements to show the monitoring status at each virtual station (feature), sorting them by the highest accumulated heat stress. By clicking the "Add Element" button and selecting "List," I placed it on the left side of the dashboard. I linked the layers from the Coral Reef Bleaching web map I had created and expanded the NOAA Coral Reef Watch (CRW) Virtual Stations layer. I sorted the Degree Heating Weeks, representing accumulated heat stress, in descending order and updated the list text to dynamically display the monitoring status at each virtual station.

On the Actions tab, I enabled the "Show Pop-Up" option for the Coral Reef Bleaching feature to display pop-ups whenever a location was selected. I then added a serial chart to show the number of virtual stations by alert level, ranging from 0 (no bleaching) to 4 (severe bleaching). I placed the chart on the left side of the dashboard, sourcing the layer from the Coral Reef Bleaching web map and expanding the NOAA Coral Reef Watch (CRW) Virtual Stations layer. In the Data Options pane, I selected "Alert Level" for the Category Field. I adjusted the labels for each category on the x-axis in the Category Axis tab and changed the y-axis label to "Number of Coral Stations" in the Value Axis tab. In the Series tab, I chose "By Category" for the Bar Color option, assigning different colors to represent the severity of coral bleaching: light blue for No Alert, light yellow for Watch, peach for Warning, light brown for Level 1, and dark brown for Level 2. These labels were updated on the axis in the previous step. To ensure the actions worked, the elements had to share a data source or be mapped to the data source. I filtered the Target Field to "Alert Level" in the Actions tab, so clicking on the bar graph for an alert level would show the corresponding points on the map.

Finally, I added an indicator element to the top left corner of the map to display dynamic summary statistics based on attribute fields in the dashboard data. This indicator reported the number of virtual stations indicating that the coral reef was at risk of bleaching. Again, I selected the Coral Reef Bleaching web map from the Virtual Stations layer of NOAA Coral Reef Watch (CRW). In the Data Options pane, I built an expression filter stating _Alert Level Greater Than Or Equal 3_ to show the number of stations with a Level 1 or 2 alert. To provide context, I included the total count of virtual stations. In the Reference section, I chose "Statistic" for the Reference type. In the Indicator Options pane, I typed "Coral reefs at risk of bleaching" out of the total number of stations. Lastly, I configured the actions to ensure the different elements of the dashboard could interact with each other.

## Lessons Learned:

I discovered how to source web maps from ArcGIS Online into ArcGIS Dashboards to create dynamic and interactive maps. By isolating specific layers, I ensured they were prominently displayed on the dashboard I was creating. Utilizing data points from these layers allowed the pop-ups to convey meaningful information, enhancing the viewing experience and inspiring people to take action. 

With a variety of customization options at my disposal, I could design a stylish and personalized layout on Dashboards. I was thrilled by the process and amazed at how even small actions could culminate in a tool that could help many people and drive societal change. The versatility of GIS continuously astonishes me, given its straightforward premise of creating maps for others to use.

Witnessing the interactivity between different apps on ArcGIS coming together to create fantastic products was both fascinating and gratifying. Itâ€™s incredible to see how these tools can seamlessly integrate to produce something impactful and beneficial.
