# CartoCraft: Applied ESRI Cartography & Map Design
I participated in a cartography class led by seasoned GIS professionals, aimed at inspiring participants to move beyond default mapping templates. The course challenged us to push our creative boundaries and craft dynamic, impactful maps that transcend convention. Through this experience, I acquired advanced skills in both ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online, enabling me to create visually stunning and engaging maps that effectively communicate complex spatial information.
