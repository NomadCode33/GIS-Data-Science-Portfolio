# Using GIS to address climate change
An ArcGIS StoryMap that highlights my GIS work on studying and addressing climate change, designed to share my findings and spark further dialogue.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** ArcGIS StoryMaps, ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Instant Apps, ArcGIS Dashboards, ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World, ArcGIS Survey123, ArcGIS Network Analyst

I began by downloading the necessary files and creating a new story on ArcGIS StoryMaps. I started with the basics, adding a title, a captivating introduction, and a roadmap to ensure great flow throughout the StoryMap. This setup effectively set the stage for the contents and outline of the story.

I used the Sidecar feature to create slides that seamlessly switch between topics. The first slide, "Visualizing Climate Change Data," included a subheading discussing weather variables and the creation of climate models combined with GIS to plan for future climate change impacts. I provided an example using ArcGIS Instant Apps to showcase the Rondonia Land Cover Change from 1992 to 2020, displayed on the right side of the screen.

The second slide, "Mitigating Greenhouse Gases," emphasized the importance of spatial data in mitigating greenhouse gases. It highlighted the use of location data to analyze and visualize information for both local and global applications. The slide featured an example from ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Navigator, illustrating optimized vehicular routes to reduce fuel consumption and emissions.

The third slide focused on "Electricity Sources," drawing attention to the benefits of clean energy, such as solar power. I showcased a 3D web scene from ArcGIS Pro, uploaded to ArcGIS Online, which displayed buildings with varying levels of solar radiation potential. The visualization used shades of blue for lower energy potential and shades of yellow, orange, and red for higher potential.

In the fourth slide, "Understanding Exposure to Climate-Related Hazards," I addressed the impact of climate-related disasters like flooding, drought, and extreme heat. I used a 3D visualization of Miami Beach Sea Level Rise created in ArcGIS Pro to demonstrate how rising sea levels could affect infrastructure, aiding local planners and decision-makers.

The fifth slide, "Assessing Vulnerability and Risk," explored how GIS can identify localized risks to climate change and vulnerable populations. An example from ArcGIS Pro used the Presence-Only Prediction (MaxEnt) tool to show suitable locations for growing maize under current and future climate conditions. The slide featured a side-by-side comparison of suitable locations, with shades of green representing viable areas.

The sixth slide, "Investigating Risk Reduction Options and Planning," emphasized the importance of adaptation plans to increase community resilience to climate change. The Athens Heat Risk Index map, created in ArcGIS Pro and uploaded to ArcGIS Online, showcased areas prioritized for tree planting to cool the city. Darker shades of red indicated higher risk areas, while lighter shades of yellow and orange showed less risk.

The seventh slide, "Taking Action," highlighted how GIS can drive action against climate change and promote sustainability. It featured the Coral Reef Dashboard project from ArcGIS Dashboards, which monitors the health of coral reefs, crucial for coastal protection, local economies, and food sources. The dashboard provided location analytics to identify reefs at risk of bleaching.

I concluded with a call to action, encouraging viewers to continue the dialogue and contribute to the climate conversation. Finally, I published the StoryMap online, ready to share my work and inspire others.

## Lessons Learned:

I loved the process of creating this StoryMap because it represents the culmination of all my projects, coming together to create a cohesive narrative. Each project I’ve completed contributes a crucial part of the whole picture, covering all the bases. I learned to source material from various projects, including web maps, apps, dashboards, and more. This process reminded me of creating PowerPoint slides, where every detail, no matter how small, is essential for captivating the audience and making the presentation engaging.

This leads to another valuable lesson I learned: crafting a compelling story that can inspire change and motivate others to take action. It’s important to present work that is not only visually appealing but also allows the audience to grasp the real-world ramifications of our choices on the environment. The StoryMap can teach viewers that, although these issues are significant, we can take steps to address them and develop long-term preventative plans. Ultimately, it shows that we can coexist peacefully with the environment we live in, which we call Earth.
