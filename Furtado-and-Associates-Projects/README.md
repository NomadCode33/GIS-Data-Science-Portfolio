# Furtado & Associates
During my three-month GIS internship, I had the privilege of rotating through four distinct departments, each providing a unique perspective on the company's operations and deepening my understanding of the GIS field.

In the Field & Survey department, I honed my skills in precise area scanning and coordinate input using advanced technology like the Leica P50 LiDAR Scanner and Trimble S/VX Series. The data I collected was critical for clients, enabling informed decision-making during the development phase. This hands-on experience with cutting-edge equipment was invaluable and set the foundation for my technical proficiency.

My time in the GIS department was spent mastering industry-standard tools such as ArcGIS and AutoCAD Civil 3D. I began by creating basemaps from open-source GIS datasets, meticulously adhering to client standards and expectations. Using ArcGIS, I delineated the boundaries for various projects, formatted data to meet specific criteria, and ensured positional accuracy. I then imported these maps into AutoCAD Civil 3D, enhancing their layout and readability. My proficiency grew to include composing detailed raster maps, further expanding my skill set.

In the Right-Of-Way (ROW) department, I learned the importance of quality control. I conducted thorough evaluations of parcel maps, legal descriptions, and AutoCAD maps before they were distributed to clients. I performed detailed quality checks on parcel map data, ensuring it matched corresponding AutoCAD files. Additionally, I drafted legal descriptions, carefully noting essential client information, accurately delineating parcel areas, and specifying the coordinates of easements and acquisitions.

The Drafting department introduced me to the intricacies of processing 2D and 3D linework, symbology, and annotations derived from field data. I excelled in 2D fieldbook processing, skillfully adding linework to represent landmarks, roads, and structures. Moreover, I tackled 3D processing tasks, verifying that 3D polygons accurately reflected real-world topographical features.

Each department offered unique challenges and learning opportunities, contributing to a comprehensive and engaging internship experience. This journey not only refined my technical skills but also provided a holistic view of GIS applications across various facets of the company.
