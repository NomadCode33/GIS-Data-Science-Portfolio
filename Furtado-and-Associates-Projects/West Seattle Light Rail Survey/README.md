# West Seattle Light Rail Survey
In the Survey department, we collected data points for various projects, including infrastructure development, CCTV monitoring in sewers and pipelines, and forest area surveys. My role encompassed both fieldwork and office coordination.

**Disclaimer:** Furtado & Associates maintains a policy of not allowing company property for personal use, so I don't have any documents or pictures of my project. However, I can describe the work I did and the process we followed.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Trimble S/VX Total Stations, Leica P50 LiDAR Scanner, Office Database, Printer

In the Survey department, we collected data points for a variety of projects, from infrastructure development to monitoring CCTVs in sewers and pipelines, and even in forest areas. My role involved both fieldwork and office coordination.

Before heading out, we consulted with the field team for guidance on the specific area or project we were surveying. We then drove to the location with our equipment. Upon arrival, we set up our tools, such as the Leica P50 LiDAR Scanner or the Trimble S/VX Total Stations, depending on the project requirements.

### Leica P50 LiDAR Scanner
For the Sound Transit West Seattle Light Rail project, we used the Leica P50 LiDAR Scanner to collect precise data points. The process began with setting up arms over pre-installed control points, and the Leica P50 was mounted on these arms. Initially, two arms were used: one for the current point and another for the next target. The second arm had a black and white bullseye target to help the Leica P50 focus and record the next point.

Once set up, we used three arms: one for the previous point, one for the current point, and one for the next point, each with targets to ensure accurate scanning boundaries. I meticulously documented all measurements in the field book, which serves as both a legal record for data verification and potential evidence in legal disputes. The Leica P50 scanned the area in 360 degrees to create a 3D model and took photos. This process was repeated across West Seattle until all necessary points were recorded.

### Trimble S/VX Total Stations
For the same project, we also used the Trimble S/VX Total Stations to capture detailed topographical data, such as utilities, curbsides, and property lines. This data helped clients like Sound Transit plan their construction activities without encroaching on property lines or damaging essential utilities.

The Trimble setup included the main device mounted on an arm, a tablet-like computer for inputting points, and a rod with special glass for precise measurements. The Trimble device could lock onto the rod, either automatically or manually, to measure control points accurately. I verified settings and point locks on the tablet, ensuring data accuracy. Measurements, including offsets, were documented in the field book. We periodically verified reference points and repeated the process for all required points.

### Data Processing and Integration
At the end of each day, we returned to the office and uploaded all data from the Leica P50 and Trimble S/VX to the office database, scanned the field book, and other documents. The data was then processed through internal pipelines for cleaning and conversion before being delivered to clients. Tools like ArcGIS Pro and Autodesk Civil 3D were used for further processing. Once quality assurance was complete, the data was sent to Sound Transit for final processing and public release, helping both the public and the project team understand the survey results.

### CCTV Projects
For other projects, such as one in Lynnwood, we used CCTV for sewer and pipeline inspections. This involved using long measuring sticks, protractors, measuring tapes, and other tools to measure underground pipes. We documented the layout and connections of the pipes through diagrams and detailed notes.

Although I don't have visual documentation, I can convey the comprehensive and meticulous process involved in these surveying projects, from field data collection to final data processing and delivery.

## Optimizations

I didn't explicitly mention this to my coworker, but I discovered a more efficient method for identifying points. By having the Leica scan the points from the street itself rather than moving further into the area, we could save significant time and increase our overall efficiency.

## Lessons Learned:

During my time at Furtado & Associates, I learned the importance of meticulous data collection and documentation. Working with advanced tools like the Leica P50 LiDAR Scanner and Trimble S/VX Total Stations taught me the technical skills needed to capture precise data points. I also developed strong collaboration skills through field team consultations and gained experience in data processing and quality assurance. This project reinforced the necessity of accurate records and the role of technology in ensuring reliable data for large-scale infrastructure projects.
