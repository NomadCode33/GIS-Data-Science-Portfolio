# GreenMap Initiative: Mapping for Climate Action
A climate-focused GIS initiative developed as part of the ESRI GIS for Climate Action MOOC, a course led by climate and geospatial experts aimed at empowering participants to address pressing environmental challenges through advanced geospatial analysis. This project leveraged the full suite of ArcGIS tools—including ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Network Analyst, ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World, ArcGIS Instant Apps, ArcGIS Survey123, ArcGIS Dashboards, and ArcGIS StoryMaps—to illuminate climate risks, identify mitigation strategies, and support policy-driven decision-making. With a focus on resilience and sustainability, the work demonstrates the ability to communicate complex spatial data through clear, impactful visualizations that inspire informed action and community engagement.
