# ImpactAtlas: Climate Change Through Spatial Insight
An ArcGIS StoryMap that highlights my GIS work on studying and addressing climate change, designed to share my findings and spark further dialogue.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** ArcGIS StoryMaps, ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Instant Apps, ArcGIS Dashboards, ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World, ArcGIS Survey123, ArcGIS Network Analyst

I embarked on the creation of my StoryMap by downloading the necessary files and setting up a new project on ArcGIS StoryMaps. I began with the essentials: a compelling title, an engaging introduction, and a clear roadmap to guide the audience through the narrative. This structure set the stage for an immersive exploration of climate change topics, seamlessly linking each section.

To make the story dynamic and visually captivating, I utilized the Sidecar feature to create interactive slides that smoothly transition between key themes. The first slide, "Visualizing Climate Change Data," opened with an exploration of weather variables and the development of climate models combined with GIS to predict future impacts. To illustrate this, I featured an ArcGIS Instant App showcasing land cover changes in Rondonia from 1992 to 2020, which unfolded on the screen’s right side like a visual journey through time.

On the second slide, "Mitigating Greenhouse Gases," I delved into the power of spatial data to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I highlighted how location-based data can analyze and visualize patterns, benefiting both local and global sustainability efforts. An example from ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Navigator demonstrated how optimizing vehicle routes could reduce fuel consumption and emissions, bringing the concept to life with real-world relevance.

The third slide, "Electricity Sources," turned the spotlight on clean energy, particularly solar power. Here, I showcased a 3D web scene created in ArcGIS Pro and uploaded to ArcGIS Online, illustrating buildings across a city with varying levels of solar energy potential. Blue hues indicated lower potential, while yellows, oranges, and reds signaled areas rich in solar energy possibilities, painting a vivid picture of a sustainable future.

Next, in "Understanding Exposure to Climate-Related Hazards," I examined the effects of climate-related disasters such as flooding, drought, and extreme heat. A 3D visualization of Miami Beach's sea level rise, crafted in ArcGIS Pro, demonstrated the potential impact on infrastructure, offering a valuable tool for local planners and decision-makers.

The fifth slide, "Assessing Vulnerability and Risk," explored how GIS can pinpoint localized climate risks and identify vulnerable populations. An ArcGIS Pro example used the Presence-Only Prediction (MaxEnt) tool to visualize suitable locations for growing maize under current and future climate conditions. A side-by-side comparison displayed in shades of green helped viewers understand the areas most viable for cultivation.

In the sixth slide, "Investigating Risk Reduction Options and Planning," I underscored the importance of adaptation strategies for community resilience. I presented the Athens Heat Risk Index map, created in ArcGIS Pro and shared on ArcGIS Online, which highlighted areas prioritized for tree planting to cool the city. Darker reds marked higher-risk zones, while lighter yellows and oranges represented areas with less risk.

The seventh slide, "Taking Action," emphasized how GIS tools can catalyze action against climate change and foster sustainability. This slide featured the Coral Reef Dashboard project from ArcGIS Dashboards, which monitors the health of coral reefs—vital for coastal protection, local economies, and food sources. The dashboard offered valuable location analytics to identify reefs at risk of bleaching.

I wrapped up the StoryMap with a call to action, encouraging viewers to stay engaged and contribute to the climate conversation. With a sense of accomplishment, I published the StoryMap online, ready to inspire others and drive meaningful action against climate change.

## Lessons Learned:

I loved the process of creating this StoryMap because it represents the culmination of all my projects, coming together to create a cohesive narrative. Each project I’ve completed contributes a crucial part of the whole picture, covering all the bases. I learned to source material from various projects, including web maps, apps, dashboards, and more. This process reminded me of creating PowerPoint slides, where every detail, no matter how small, is essential for captivating the audience and making the presentation engaging.

This leads to another valuable lesson I learned: crafting a compelling story that can inspire change and motivate others to take action. It’s important to present work that is not only visually appealing but also allows the audience to grasp the real-world ramifications of our choices on the environment. The StoryMap can teach viewers that, although these issues are significant, we can take steps to address them and develop long-term preventative plans. Ultimately, it shows that we can coexist peacefully with the environment we live in, which we call Earth.
