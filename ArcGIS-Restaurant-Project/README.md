# ArcGIS Fast Food Restaurant Map
As part of a group project, we conducted a mobile survey of restaurants using the Fulcrum app for data collection. We then exported the data to ArcGIS Online to create a visual map.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** ArcGIS Online, Fulcrum, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word

My partner and I embarked on a fascinating project to explore the allure of fast food restaurants in Northern Seattle, despite their notorious long lines and busy nature. We sought to understand why these eateries remain so popular. To achieve this, we designed a set of questions combining objective attributes—like wait time and price range—with subjective interpretations, such as cleanliness and improvement. Our questions aimed to capture both measurable data and personal perceptions.

We asked:
- How many people are in the restaurant?
- What made you choose this restaurant?
- Does the restaurant offer online ordering or pickup?
- What was the wait time for your order?
- What price range are you willing to spend on a to-go order?
- How long was the walk to the restaurant from campus?
- Was the price reasonable for the food provided?
- How many items on the menu are under $10?
- What type of ethnic food is served?
- Is the restaurant clean?
- Does the restaurant need improvement?
- Would you return to this restaurant?

Equipped with these questions, we conducted a mobile survey using Fulcrum, a field data management app. We physically visited each location and manually inputted the GPS coordinates. Our restaurant list included Zen Noodle, Thai Tom, Subway, UDON, Chinese Sauerkraut Fish, Just Burgers, Just Poke, Chipotle, Thaiger Room, Jai Thai, MOD Pizza, Jimmy John's, Aladdin Gyro, Red Radish (HUB), Motosurf (HUB), Firecracker (HUB), DUB Street Burgers (HUB), Caribbean (HUB), and Pagliacci Pizza (HUB). Some of these were located in the Husky Union Building at the University of Washington. We visited at least nine different restaurants, collecting GPS coordinates and at least 20 observations, and we took photos to document our findings.

After completing the survey, we exported the data in CSV format and uploaded our photos to the server. We edited the CSV file in Microsoft Excel to match photos with the appropriate restaurants and organized other details.

We then transferred the Fulcrum data to ArcGIS Online to create an interactive map. We symbolized the data points based on specific values, changed the default base map to a more suitable one, updated the legend to be user-friendly, and enabled interactive pop-ups that displayed each restaurant's statistics. The map was published on the ArcGIS Online platform for public access.

Finally, my partner and I compiled a comprehensive report outlining our findings and reflections on the project. This experience taught us the importance of integrating objective data with subjective insights, the challenges of field data collection, and the power of interactive maps in visualizing and sharing our research.

## Optimizations

While the map had its strengths, it also had several significant flaws. The report and the data in the pop-up windows leaned heavily towards an interview-style explanation, focusing more on user experiences rather than the geospatial features of the restaurants. Additionally, some text in the pop-up boxes was hard to interpret, potentially discouraging viewers. In hindsight, I should have cleaned up the pop-up data by editing the text in the 'Alias' column for a more user-friendly appearance. The title needed an update, and a brief summary should have been included to clarify the map's purpose. Furthermore, altering the points' shapes and border colors would have made them more visible. These improvements would have enhanced the map's readability and overall user experience. This project was an early attempt before I mastered the fundamentals of mapmaking, a skill I have since greatly improved.

## Lessons Learned:

This project was pivotal in teaching me the fundamentals of thinking like a geographer. Our questions aimed to capture both measurable data and personal perceptions, driving us to think spatially about our primary inquiry: why do people prefer fast food restaurants despite long lines and higher prices? This intentional approach led to a more detailed analysis and ensured a thorough process. I also learned the value and challenges of field data collection, such as the importance of accurate GPS points to avoid skewed analysis—something I improved during my time with Furtado & Associates. I made a critical mistake by not properly saving each GPS point, causing all data to collapse onto a single point instead of multiple ones. This experience underscored the power of interactive maps in visualizing and sharing research, making results accessible to the public. Additionally, it taught me the importance of designing user-friendly maps from the audience's perspective. While some elements of the map didn't age well, I improved through repetition and skill development over the years.
