# Climate Change Report
This report delves into the multifaceted issue of climate change by examining economic damages, anomalies, greenhouse gas emissions, and population impacts. Utilizing extensive datasets from the World Health Organization, our research answers five key questions, with findings seamlessly integrated into a comprehensive, publicly accessible report.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** RStudio, R, Git, GitHub, HTML, CSS, JavaScript 

The project began with a brainstorming session focused on the multifaceted issue of climate change. We identified four crucial topics to explore: Economic Damages, Anomalies, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, and Population. From these themes, we crafted five key questions to guide our research: How do the recent outputs of the three major greenhouse gases in the US compare to historical global changes? What has been the impact of carbon dioxide emissions on economic growth over the past 20 years? How have carbon dioxide emissions affected land and ocean anomalies? Which 12 countries were most affected in 2009, and how did this impact their agricultural output? Lastly, which countries have contributed the most to greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 to 2018?

With our roadmap in place, we turned to the World Health Organization’s extensive datasets, which provided a global perspective on climate change impacts. My focus was on answering the fourth question: identifying the top 12 countries affected in 2009 and examining how their agricultural output was impacted. This required delving into data on populations affected by climate change and the percentage of GDP impacted in the agricultural sector. By meticulously extracting, loading, and transforming WHO datasets, I pinpointed countries like Switzerland and Malawi, whose agricultural sectors were significantly impacted. This data was then seamlessly integrated into our project’s website.

Collaboration was key in our project, and GitHub was instrumental in enabling us to share our work and synchronize our efforts. The platform facilitated continuous integration and collaborative data storage, ensuring that our individual contributions came together smoothly.

After extensive data wrangling and analysis, we compiled our findings into a comprehensive report, which we published for public accessibility.


## Optimizations

One significant improvement was the automation of data extraction processes, which saved time and ensured accuracy. By implementing scripts to pull data directly from the WHO's database, we minimized human error and increased efficiency. Additionally, integrating interactive data visualizations enriched the user experience, allowing for a more engaging exploration of the data. These visualizations were crucial in highlighting key findings and making complex information accessible to a broader audience. We also optimized our code for better performance, ensuring that the website ran smoothly even with large datasets. Furthermore, we enhanced our report's accessibility by incorporating responsive design elements, making it easily viewable on various devices.

While our project was successful, there is always room for improvement. One area that could be refined is the granularity of the data. We could incorporate more localized data to provide a more detailed picture of climate change impacts at the regional level. Additionally, expanding our dataset sources beyond WHO to include other reputable organizations would add depth to our analysis. Enhancing the interactivity of our visualizations with more dynamic, real-time data updates could also keep our findings current and relevant. Finally, integrating user feedback mechanisms would allow us to continually improve the website based on user experiences and suggestions, ensuring that our project remains a valuable resource for understanding and addressing climate change.

## Lessons Learned:

This project was an eye-opener in many ways. I learned the importance of meticulous planning and the value of clear, guiding questions in structuring a research project. The experience underscored the necessity of reliable data sources, such as the World Health Organization, in obtaining accurate and comprehensive information. Collaborating with my team through GitHub taught me the significance of effective communication and the power of technology in facilitating teamwork. Moreover, the process of data extraction, transformation, and analysis honed my technical skills and highlighted the intricate connections between climate change and various socio-economic factors. Ultimately, this project deepened my understanding of climate change's multifaceted impacts and reinforced the critical need for collaborative, data-driven approaches to address global challenges.
